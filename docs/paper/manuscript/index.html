Tool support is essential for application engineering in software product lines for the derivation of products from reusable assets. Existing tools are more or less specialized in terms of the artifacts and the variability mechanisms that they address. There is the open problem of providing general configurability and extensibility with regard to the artifacts and variability mechanisms for such tools. This paper addresses the problem by exploring the underlying commonality and adequately managing variability of tools for product derivation. More specifically, the paper describes domain analysis, design, implementation of Hephaestus-PL---a proper product line for such tools. To this end, an extractive strategy was applied to the existing Hephaestus tool. Variability management relies on metaprogramming. We also describe a process for evolving Hephaestus-PL to address new artifacts. Improved configurability and extensibility is substantiated by an assessment.
