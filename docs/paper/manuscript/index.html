  Tool support is essential for application engineering in software
  product lines for the derivation of products from reusable assets.

  Existing tools are more or less specialized in terms of the
  artifacts and the variability mechanisms that they address. There is
  the open problem of providing general configurability, flexibility, and
  extensibility with regard to the artifacts and variability
  mechanisms for such tools.

  This paper addresses the problem by exploring the underlying
  commonality and adequately managing variability of tools for product
  derivation. More specifically, the paper presents domain analysis,
  design, implementation, and a supporting process for enhancing the
  existing Hephaestus tool for software product lines into Hephaestus-PL---a proper
  product line for such tools. Such enhancement is essentially a form
  of bootstrapping.

  An assessment substantiates that Hephaestus actually provides improved
  configurability, flexibility, and extensibility when compared to
  previous versions of Hephaestus.
